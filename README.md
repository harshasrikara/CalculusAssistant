# CalculusAssistant

This project was designed to calculate derivatives.
Input is written in a text file and the derivative will be logged to console

### Features
Implementation of a linked list to hold entries of each node.
Multiple operators were overloaded
Ability to derive trig functions

### Format Required For Input

##### Examples
 - 6x + 3
 - -9x^2 + 2x^-3
 - 3sin x + -4cos 5x + 2

##### Requirements
There must be a space on either side of each operation. 
When using a trig function, there must be a space after the trig function
All number can be positive or negative.
Only sin, cos and tan are supported within the program

### Up Next
 - Ability to handle fractions
 - Ability to handle Log data
 - Ability to log to a text file
